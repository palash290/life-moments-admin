As my children were growing up I also took photos and videos, before they were even born of their Mummy's tummy and then photos and videos of them as new borns including their first bath at the Hospital. This extended through to their Birthday parties, first day of Kindergarten, sporting events, award nights and much, much, more.\\n\\nNaturally, I then backed up my photos from my phone and camera to my laptop and thought I'd done the right thing. Years later and several laptops later, I found I couldn't even switch on those old machines and I feared I had lost all those recordings forever. I'm told they may be accessible by a computer specialist but they're still sitting in the old machines to this day. I also had pictures and videos of my children on camera memory cards, which unfortunately have been misplaced somewhere along the way. And then there's the many photos in Facebook, where the quality gets dropped to assist with storage. It seems I wasn't very good at getting my digital life in order.\\n\\nSo the concept behind Life's Moments was to create a place where I could store all of these moments safely and have them always accessible in the palm of my hand.\\n\\nAnd in the process of doing this, I have created an App where  you can capture , store and organize YOUR Life's Moments and have immediate access to them along the journey and then hopefully pass them down to future generations to come.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy Life's Moments too and we welcome any feedback along the way to help us improve our service to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nAndrew Flynn\\nFounder",
